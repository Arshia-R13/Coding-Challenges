for the first Challeng i have to write a code in C++, to import a test.txt in C++ und calculate the bytes of text.

the output have to be so :
>ccwc -c test.txt
  342190 test.txt

# i think, my output has to be the number of bytes of Text but i want to be exatly like the output of website.

my Code in C++:

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char *argv[] ) {

    // Check if enough arguments were passed
    if (argc < 2){
        cerr << "Please enter the File-Name as the program-argument" << endl;
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // The file name is extracted from the program arguments
    string fileName = argv[1];

    // Open a file stream
    ifstream file(fileName, ios::binary);

    // Check, whether the file was opened successfully
    if (!file.is_open()){
        cerr << "unable to open the file." << endl;
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // count the Bytes in file
    file.seekg(0, ios::end);
    streampos fileSize = file.tellg();
    cout << ">ccwc -c test.txt"<< "\n" << "  " << fileSize << " test.txt" << endl;

    // close the file
    file.close();

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
